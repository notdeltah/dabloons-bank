# The Dabloons Bank

The Dabloons Bank is a tool to help you keep track of your TikTok currency, Dabloons.
You can also check if you can afford items, and if you can, add them to your virtual Inventory!

- Running Dabloon balance
- Virtual Inventory
- Transaction History

This tool uses Python 3.11 and will not work if you haven't installed it on your system. If you haven't yet installed it, you can do so [here](https://www.python.org/downloads)!


## Instructions

To use the Dabloons Bank, you must first install Python. There is a link above. Once that's done, simply hit that big green Code dropdown and click "Download ZIP".

Open where you've installed it and extract the ZIP file by right clicking and pressing the button that says something along the lines of "Extract here". That done, go into the folder it's created and double-click the `main.py` file to run the app.

If you've done everything correctly, you should have a little terminal window saying something like the following:

```
--------------------
 Welcome to the Dabloons Bank!
 Select an option below to update your balance:
  1 - I've been given Dabloons
  2 - I've been robbed
  3 - I want to check my transactions
  4 - I've made a purchase
 You have 0 Dabloons
--------------------
```
Simply type the number corresponding to the action you wish to take and press enter. It'll then save your changes, so the next time you enter the bank you will have all of your Dabloons, items, transactions etc. still available to you.

### If DB doesn't open or crashes, please report it [here](https://github.com/notdeltah/dabloons-bank/issues/new). Thanks! :)
#### Dabloons Bank will create a file called `data.json`. This file contains all the details about your balance, transactions and items. If you delete this file, it will reset everything and you will start from nothing again. Do not delete this file unless you really want to reset your balance.
